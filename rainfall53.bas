' Analysis of 53 years of rainfall by year and month.
' Coded by: Rick Henderson, Twitter: @rickhenderson
' ======================================================
' Given a worksheet with the following data:
' For example, containing daily rainfall readings every day for many years
'  if the date is in mm/dd/yyyy format in the Excel worksheet.
' | Date       | Rainfall |
' | 01/01/2016 | 7.21     |
'      ...           ...
' The subroutine calculate_rainfall_by_month() will calcluate the monthly totals of rainfall
' and output them to another worksheet by year and month in the following format:
'
' | Year | Jan | Feb | Mar |.........|
' | 2016 | 34.4| 2.3 | 7.3 |.........|
' | ...  | ...
'
' This module also contains a subroutine called calculate_yearly_rainfall() to
' calculate the total for each year of the data set.
'
' Both subroutines should also work when the data changes, even if some
' dates are missing.
'
' The sheet names are coded inside the sub so you will have to change those for re-use
' By using conditional formatting, this could potentially generate an Excel heatmap.
