# tripping-vba
May 21, 2015:
Testing out using GitHub for VBA code. Wondering how it would be structured, probably basic .bas files.

Can't upload files from the GitHub site, so I created new files in the repository and copied the code into them.
This creates challenges with VBA because it uses modules which can be saved as .bas files, but also uses .frm files which contains code and other information.
